        <h3>EBR Schools CompTIA Training</h3>
        <p>
          We are working in partnership with East Baton Rouge Schools to help
          teach CompTIA to a group of students over the summer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students will have the opportunity to earn a CompTIA certificate at
          the end of the program.

        <h3>Big Buddy Program Python Class</h3>
        <p>
          We are partnering with the Big Buddy Program to teach Python to a
          group of highschool students. This program is a part of the
          Mayor&apos;s Youth Workforce Experience program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students are learning Python from the ground up through project-based
          learning, and will have a chance to earn a Industry Based
          Certification at the end of the program.

        <h3>Python Certification for LA</h3>
        <p>
          We had the privilege of partnering with the LA Department of
          Corrections to help get a Python Industry Based Certification approved
          by the LA Workforce Commission.
        </p>
        <p>This helps groups in LA be able to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>More easily access funding for Python training.</li>
          <li>
            Win support for expanding efforts to train students in computer
            science.
          </li>
          <li>
            Help students earn industry-recognized credentials while in school.
          </li>
